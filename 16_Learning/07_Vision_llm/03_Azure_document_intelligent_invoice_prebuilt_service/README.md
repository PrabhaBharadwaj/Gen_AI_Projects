  ## Models and Techniques

  - This evaluation focused on multiple techniques for data extraction with the language models:

  - **Markdown Extraction with Azure AI Document Intelligence.** This technique involves converting the document into Markdown using the pre-built layout model in Azure AI Document Intelligence. Read more about this technique in our detailed article.
  - **Vision Capabilities of Multi-Modal Language Models.** This technique focuses on GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini models by converting the document pages to images. This leverages the modelsâ€™ capabilities to analyze both text and visual elements. Explore this technique in more detail in our sample project.
  - **Comprehensive Combination.** This technique combines both Markdown extraction with vision capable models to enhance the extraction process. Additionally, the layout analysis of Azure AI Document Intelligence will ease the human review of a document if the confidence or accuracy is low.
