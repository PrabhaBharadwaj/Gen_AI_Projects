It works by taking a series of messages as input and producing a message as output. This feature is versatile, as it can handle both multi-turn conversations (where there's a back-and-forth exchange) and single-turn tasks (where only a direct response is needed).\n","\n","Here's how you can use it:\n","\n","1. **Setting Up**: You begin by importing the OpenAI library and initializing the client, as shown in the example.\n","\n","2. **Creating a Conversation**: The core of this API is the conversation format. You use the `chat.completions.create` method, specifying the model (like \"gpt-3.5-turbo\") and a list of messages.\n","\n","3. **Understanding Messages**: Each message in the conversation is an object that has two parts: a role and content. The role can be \"system\", \"user\", or \"assistant\".\n","    - **System Message**: This is optional. It sets the initial tone or instructions for the assistant, like \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n","    - **User Message**: This is where you, as the user, ask questions or make statements.\n","    - **Assistant Message**: This is the AI's response. You can also prefill this with examples of how you want the AI to respond.\n","\n","4. **Building the Conversation**: A typical conversation begins with a system message, followed by alternating user and assistant messages. The assistant's responses depend on the user's messages and the context provided by previous interactions.\n","\n","5. **Contextual Responses**: It's important to include the conversation history, especially when the user's messages refer to earlier parts of the conversation. Since the model doesn't remember past interactions, all necessary information must be included in the current conversation.\n","\n","6. **Handling Long Conversations**: If a conversation becomes too long for the model’s token limit, you'll need to condense or shorten it.\n","\n","This API is powerful for creating natural, interactive dialogues with an AI, whether for customer service, educational purposes, or other interactive applications. By structuring the conversation with clear roles and context, you can guide the AI to provide relevant and accurate responses."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"id":"7815f0f3-e821-45b9-b34e-0206ab16e715","metadata":{"id":"7815f0f3-e821-45b9-b34e-0206ab16e715","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1735738184372,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"prabha Melady","userId":"18413778025838058766"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from openai import OpenAI\n","client = OpenAI()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"id":"b5075452-f83d-4557-a924-7c4c54ce9253","metadata":{"id":"b5075452-f83d-4557-a924-7c4c54ce9253","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1735738187261,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":872,"user":{"displayName":"prabha Melady","userId":"18413778025838058766"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["response = client.chat.completions.create(\n","    model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n","    messages = [\n","    {'role':'system','content':'You are a helpful assistant.'},\n","    {'role':'user','content':'What is the capital of France?'}\n","    ]\n","\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"05aa85e2-5553-41f9-8e1a-442bfec6074b","metadata":{"id":"05aa85e2-5553-41f9-8e1a-442bfec6074b","outputId":"edf4dd1f-c9d2-4c33-bea5-fd03e3d7e88a","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":186},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1735738189271,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":597,"user":{"displayName":"prabha Melady","userId":"18413778025838058766"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["openai.types.chat.chat_completion.ChatCompletion"],"text/html":["<div style=\"max-width:800px; border: 1px solid var(--colab-border-color);\"><style>\n","      pre.function-repr-contents {\n","        overflow-x: auto;\n","        padding: 8px 12px;\n","        max-height: 500px;\n","      }\n","\n","      pre.function-repr-contents.function-repr-contents-collapsed {\n","        cursor: pointer;\n","        max-height: 100px;\n","      }\n","    </style>\n","    <pre style=\"white-space: initial; background:\n","         var(--colab-secondary-surface-color); padding: 8px 12px;\n","         border-bottom: 1px solid var(--colab-border-color);\"><b>openai.types.chat.chat_completion.ChatCompletion</b><br/>def __init__(self, /, **data: Any) -&gt; None</pre><pre class=\"function-repr-contents function-repr-contents-collapsed\" style=\"\"><a class=\"filepath\" style=\"display:none\" href=\"#\">/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/openai/types/chat/chat_completion.py</a>Usage docs: https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.10/concepts/models/\n","\n","A base class for creating Pydantic models.\n","\n","Attributes:\n","    __class_vars__: The names of the class variables defined on the model.\n","    __private_attributes__: Metadata about the private attributes of the model.\n","    __signature__: The synthesized `__init__` [`Signature`][inspect.Signature] of the model.\n","\n","    __pydantic_complete__: Whether model building is completed, or if there are still undefined fields.\n","    __pydantic_core_schema__: The core schema of the model.\n","    __pydantic_custom_init__: Whether the model has a custom `__init__` function.\n","    __pydantic_decorators__: Metadata containing the decorators defined on the model.\n","        This replaces `Model.__validators__` and `Model.__root_validators__` from Pydantic V1.\n","    __pydantic_generic_metadata__: Metadata for generic models; contains data used for a similar purpose to\n","        __args__, __origin__, __parameters__ in typing-module generics.
