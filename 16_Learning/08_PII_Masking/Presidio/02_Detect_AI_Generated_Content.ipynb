    "# Detect AI-generated Content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "- **AI-generated content** refers to the output (text, code, images, etc.) produced by GenAI / Large Language Models (LLMs) that are trained on big data containing a wide range of writing styles, topics, and sources, triggered by input prompt and are capable of generating human-like text. These LLMs have the ability to understand context and  mimic the writing style of specific individuals or sources to generate text that is remarkably coherent and contextually appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits \n",
    "- AI is your copilot / virtual assistant for productivity & creativity\n",
    "- AI-generated text opens up a new door to content creation, customer service, and automated journalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks\n",
    "- With the rise of ChatGPT (LLMs in general), AI-generated text has become increasingly indistinguishable from human-generated content. Without checks and balances, some people will use AI irresponsibly. This raises concerns about the potential **misuse of AI for spreading disinformation or generating fraudulent content**, which requires businesses to take extra steps to ensure employees use AI responsibly and ethically.\n",

These flowers not only add color and fragrance to your outdoor space but also ensure that your garden remains in bloom for an extended period. Some popular long-lasting flower species for gardens include roses, marigolds, petunias, and geraniums. Roses are known for their longevity and come in a variety of colors and sizes, making them a versatile choice. Marigolds are not only visually appealing but also repel pests, making them a practical addition to any garden. Petunias are low-maintenance and can withstand various weather conditions, making them perfect for beginners. Lastly, geraniums are known for their vibrant blooms and can thrive in both sun and shade. By incorporating these long-lasting flower species into your garden, you can enjoy a beautiful and flourishing outdoor space throughout the seasons.\n"
